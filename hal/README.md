# About the STRDC HAL Libraries
The STRDC HAL libraries are specific implementations of hardware platforms. Creating a HAL library allows developers to use abstracted drivers to make peripherals platform agnostic.

See the teensyduino HAL for an example on creating a new HAL library. Functions, definitions, and peripheral handlers should match in name and behavior to make integration seemless.
