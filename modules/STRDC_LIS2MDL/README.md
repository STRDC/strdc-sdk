# About the LIS2MDL
The STMicroelectronics LIS2MDL is an ultra-low power, high performance 3-axis magnetometer intended for compasses, mobile and virtual reality devices. The sensor includes an internal temperature sensor, a low-pass filter for attenuating noise, configrable magnetic threshold interrupts, high-resolution and low-power modes. Intended applications:

- Tilt-compensated compasses
- Virtual Reality (VR)
- Mobile Devices

# About the STRDC LIS2MDL Library
The STRDC LIS2MDL library delivers the functionality of this low-power absolute pressure and temperature sensor, abstracting the minutia of lower level tasks so the user can spend more time prototyping, less time setting up. Main features:

- Initialization and configuration of the sensor settings
- Software Reset
- Configurable output data rate
- Interrupt configuration
- Sensor mode configuration
- Intuitive examples to make getting started easy

# Module Status
Support for I2C. SPI (3-wire and 4-wire) and interrupts are experimental at the moment.
