# About the BNO08X Family
The BNO085/BNO086 integrates a 9-axis IMU (triaxial accelerometer, triaxial gyroscope, and triaxial magnetometer) with an ARM Cortex M0+ MCU. The onboard software includes sophisticated signal processing algorithms to provide real-time 3D orientation, heading, calibrated acceleration and calibrated angular velocity. It's compact size, high accuracy, Android compatability, and extensive integration makes it the ultimate plug-and-play motion sensing solution for engineers and innovators. This sensor fusion sensor hub is an excellent solution for many motion sensing applications:

- Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR)
- Robotics
- Wearables
- Mobile Devices

# About the STRDC BNO08X Library
Intended for the STRDC BNO085 Breakout board, the STRDC BNO08X library brings to life the BNO08X family of 9-axis IMUs. This library breaks out the features of the BNO08X family, making prototyping faster than ever. Main features:

- Implementation and abstraction of CEVA SHTP protocol
- Initialization and startup
- Access to BNO08X feature reports with simplified functions such as Rotation Vector, Gyro, etc...
- Using local handler objects to allow for multiple BNO08X to be used in the same program
- Message and feature report storage and handling
- Intuitive examples to make getting started easy

# Module Status
Turntable Interactive Self-Calibration, Tap Detection, Pickup Detection, Sleep Detection, Pocket Detection, and Heart Rate Monitor are experimental (functions are commented out) at the moment.
